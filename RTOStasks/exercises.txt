		a)
			Q. Why does FreeRTOS implement a separate dynamic memory management service instead of using C standard library services?

			A. 
				Standard c library malloc and free may not be allways awaivable in embended systems.
				They take up valuable code space and they are not thread safe.
				They are not deterministic.
				FreeRTOS separate implemented dynamic memory management services are more effient than most 
				c library malloc implementations, because they are made for specific purpose, but standard
				functions are made to be more generic.

		b)
			Q. Why is Heap_1.c implementation particularly suitable for embedded real-time systems?

			A. 	In many embended real-time systems memory allocations are done in system boot 
				so this means that there is no need to delete task, queue, semaphore, mutex, etc.
				This makes code allways deterministic and total code size can be smaller.
