ToDo 2:
a) 
	Q.  Knowing that FIR calculation for each tap is one addition and one multiplication, 
		estimate the amount of execution time required for a 10-tap floating point FIR filter (based on your measurements above).
	   
	A.   10*(0,5us + 0,5us) = 10 us

b)
	Q. 	Study meadian filter implementation in http://www.embedded.com/design/programming-languages-and-tools/4399504/Better-Than-Average 
		This particular implementation is claimed to suit real-time systems. Why?

	A. 	By the text, this is tested with a slow microcontroller. It reads values from enviorment by light-sensor.
		Values are temporary stored in memory and  the both extremevalues from the high and low side will be ignored.
		Thats why the median will be stronger and it fits well to real time systems.



c)
	Q. 	Implement Arduino code to feed the filter with random (int) numbers. 
		Measure filter execution time when filter length N=11. Note that you must fill the filter with N samples before measuring.
	
	A.	78,75us

d)

	Q.

	A.

e)
	Q.  Measure filter execution time with different filter lengths to prove whether O(N) claim holds. 
		Document your results.

	A. 	Exucution time increaces lieneary so meaning that complexity O(N).
