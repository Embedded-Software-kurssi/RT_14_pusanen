a)
	Q.	Measure the execution time of one inference loop in example code.

	A. 	884,81 µs	

b) 
	Q.	Determine the number of inputs, number of input fuzzy sets, number of inference rules, 
		number of outputs and number of output fuzzy sets for the example system. 
		See article "Computational complexity of general fuzzy logic control and its simplification for a loop controller" for reference. 
		Does the system have triangular or non-specific fuzzy sets? Does the system have minimum or product inference (or neither)? 
		Does the system use Mean-of-maximum or Center-of-area method for defuzzification (or neither)?

	A.
		inputs: 2
		input fuzzy sets: 7
		inference rules: 15
		outputs: 1
		output fuzzy sets: 7
		
		System has triangular fuzzy sets.



c)
	Q.	Measure the effect of each variable listed above to execution time. 
		In theory, you would add/remove one rule (or other variable)
		and measure the change in execution time.

	A. 
		Removed one inference rule and executiontime is 815,69 µs
		Removed one angle rule and executiontime is 777,44 µs
		Removed one velocity rule and executiontime is 878,75 µs
		Removed one force rule and executiontime is 829,69 µs
