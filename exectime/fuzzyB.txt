a)
	Q.	Measure the execution time of one inference loop in example code.

	A. 	2 152us	

b) 
	Q.	Determine the number of inputs, number of input fuzzy sets, number of inference rules, number of outputs and number of output fuzzy sets for the example system. 
		See article "Computational complexity of general fuzzy logic control and its simplification for a loop controller" for reference. 
		Does the system have triangular or non-specific fuzzy sets? Does the system have minimum or product inference (or neither)? 
		Does the system use Mean-of-maximum or Center-of-area method for defuzzification (or neither)?

	A.
		number of inputs 
		fuzzy sets: 3
		inference rules: 15
		outputs: 2
